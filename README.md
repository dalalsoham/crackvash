# Crackvash
![intro img](https://github.com/Itsmmdoha/crackvash/blob/af6678a912ac96dfa9173d5eeb6d12378d88a20d/crackvash.png?raw=true)

It's a python tool that lets you hack into Udvash accounts. It allows users to hack into Udvash accounts using OTP brute-force attack. It uses multi threading. So, the process is quick, takes no more than 2-3 minutes with decent internet connection. Or, if you are lucky it could do that in seconds as well!



## Warning:

This is a POC (Proof Of Concept) script. I found the vulnerability, and I made a tool that can exploit it, just to prove a point. If you use it with ill intent, well, you are on your own. I will not be responsible for what you do.

## Features

- Randomized OTP brute-forcing
- Self Generate OTP list
- Multi-threading support

## Installation and Usage


### Method 01:
> *Note:* this method is for linux users only

if you want the fastest way possible
**Just copy and pase the below command**
```bash
wget "https://github.com/Itsmmdoha/crackvash/releases/download/v1.0.0/crackvash" -q && chmod +x crackvash && clear && ./crackvash
```


### Method 02:
> *Note:* this method works on any os with python installed

If you wish to run it from source, you have to install the required modules before running it. Just run the following commands:

- Clone the repository:
```bash
    git clone https://github.com/itsmmdoha/crackvash
```

- navigate to the crackvash directory:
```bash
    cd crackvash
```

- install required modules:
```bash
  pip install -r requirements.txt
```
- finally run the main.py file
```bash
    python3 main.py
```
- Then, just follow the onscreen instructions.

## Contributing
contributions are always welcome! Below is a list of things I would like to add as a features:
1. verify the credentials before starting an attack
2. build a better cli-UI
   
## How does it work?

The web portal sends a 4-digit OTP to the user; this tool cracks it by trying all 10 thousand combinations.
It first loads all the combinations from the 4digits.txt file and randomizes it. After that, it loads all the combinations into a queue so that multi-threading can be used. Then, it just tries all of them until one is matched.

The brute-force can take 20 seconds if you are lucky or can also extend up to 2-3 minutes. But if you have a fast internet connection, I promise it won't take much longer than that.
